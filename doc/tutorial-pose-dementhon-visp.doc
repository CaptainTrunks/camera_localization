\section intro_dementhon Introduction

An alternative and very elegant solution to pose estimation from points has been proposed in \cite DD95 \cite ODD96. This algorithm is called POSIT.

\section dementhon_code Source code

The following source code that uses <a href="http://visp.inria.fr">ViSP</a> is also available in pose-dementhon-visp.cpp file. It allows to compute the pose of the camera from points.

\include pose-dementhon-visp.cpp

\section dementon_explained Source code explained

First of all we include ViSP headers that are requested to manipulate vectors and matrices.

Then we introduce the function that does the pose estimation. It takes as input parameters \f${^w}{\bf X} = (X,Y,Z,1)^T\f$ the 3D coordinates of the points in the world frame and \f${\bf x} = (x,y,1)^T\f$ their normalized coordinates in the image plane. It returns the estimated pose as an homogeneous matrix transformation.

The implementation of the POSIT algorithm is done next.

After a minimal number of iterations, all the parameters are estimated and can be used to update the value of the homogenous transformation.

Finally we define the main() function in which we will initialize the input data before calling the previous function and computing the pose using Dementhon POSIT algorithm.

\snippet pose-dementhon-visp.cpp Main function

First in the main() we create the data structures that will contain the 3D points coordinates \e wX in the world frame, and their coordinates in the image plane \e x obtained after prerspective projection. Note here that at least 4 non coplanar points are requested to estimate the pose. 

\snippet pose-dementhon-visp.cpp Create data structures

For our simulation we then initialize the input data from a ground truth pose \e cTw_truth. 
For each point we set in wX[i] the 3D coordinates in the world frame (wX, wY, wZ, 1) and compute in cX their 3D coordinates (cX, cY, cZ, 1) in the camera frame. Then in x[i] we update their coordinates (x, y) in the image plane, obtained by perspective projection.

From here we have initialized \f${^w}{\bf X} = (X,Y,Z,1)^T\f$ and \f${\bf x} = (x,y,1)^T\f$. We are now ready to call the function that does the pose estimation.

\section dementhon_result Resulting pose estimation

If you run the previous code, it we produce the following result that shows that the estimated pose is very close to the ground truth one used to generate the input data:
