\section intro Introduction

The homography can be decomposed to retrieve the pose. We consider here that all the points lie in the plane \f${^w}Z=0\f$.

\section dlt_code Source code

The following source code also available in pose-from-homography-dlt.cpp allows to compute the pose of the camera from at least 4 coplanar points.

\include pose-from-homography-dlt.cpp

\section dlt_explained Source code explained

First of all we include the header of the files that are requested to manipulate vectors and matrices.

Then we introduce the function that does the homography estimation from coplanar points. This function is detailed in \ref tutorial-homography.

\code
vpMatrix homography_dlt(const std::vector< vpColVector > &x1, const std::vector< vpColVector > &x2)
{
  ...
}
\endcode

Then we introduce the function that does the pose from homography estimation.
\snippet pose-from-homography-dlt.cpp Estimation function

Based on equation (37) \f${\bf x}_0 = {^0}{\bf H}_w {\bf x}_w\f$ we first estimate the homography \f${^0}{\bf H}_w\f$.

Then using the constraint that \f$||{\bf c}^0_1|| = 1\f$ we normalize the homography.

We compute matrix M with \f${\bf M} = {\Pi}^{-1} \; {^0}{\bf H}_w\f$  

\snippet pose-from-homography-dlt.cpp Compute M

Noting that matrix M is also equal to \f${\bf M} = ({\bf c}^0_1, {\bf c}^0_2, {^0}{\bf T}_w)\f$ we are able to extract the corresponding vectors.

The third column of the rotation matrix is computed such as \f${\bf c}^0_3= {\bf c}^0_1 \times {\bf c}^0_2\f$

To finish we update the homogeneous transformation that corresponds to the estimated pose \f${^0}{\bf T}_w\f$.

\snippet pose-from-homography-dlt.cpp Update pose

Finally we define the main() function in which we will initialize the input data before calling the previous function and computing the pose from the estimated homography.

\snippet pose-from-homography-dlt.cpp Main function

Then we create the data structures that will contain the 3D points coordinates \e wX in the world frame, their coordinates in the camera frame \e oX and their normalized coordinates \e xw and \e xo. Note here that at least 4 coplanar points are requested to estimate the 8 parameters of the homography. 

\snippet pose-from-homography-dlt.cpp Create data structures

For our simulation we then initialize the input data from a ground truth pose \e oTw_truth. 
For each point we set the values (oX, oY, oZ, xo, yo). According to equation (37) we also set \f${\bf x}_w = ({^w}X, {^w}Y, 1)\f$ in \e xw vector.
\snippet pose-from-homography-dlt.cpp Simulation

From here we have initialized \f${\bf x_0} = (x_0,y_0,1)^T\f$ and \f${\bf x}_w = ({^w}X, {^w}Y, 1)^T\f$. We are now ready to call the function that does the pose estimation.

\section dlt_result Resulting pose estimation

If you run the previous code, it we produce the following result that shows that the estimated pose is equal to the ground truth one used to generate the input data:

\code
