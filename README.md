camera_localization
===================

The aim of this project is to provide researchers and practitioners with an almost  comprehensive and consolidate 
introduction to effective tools to facilitate  research in augmented reality. It is also dedicated to academics involved in teaching augmented reality at the undergraduate and graduate level. 

For most of the presented approaches presented in the submitted paper:

	E. Marchand, H. Uchiyama and F. Spindler. Camera localization for augmented reality: A tutorial and survey. 

we provide the code of short examples. This should allow developers to easily bridge the gap between theoretical aspects and practice.  These examples have been written using <a href="http://team.inria.fr/lagadic/visp">ViSP library</a> developed at Inria.
